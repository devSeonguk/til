### Code that not only works but also explains clearly to people.
---
1. Use searchable names
2. Function names should be verbs, Function should only do one thing
3. Use arguments less than 4, When you need many arguments, use one single configuration object
4. Avoid passing boolean values to arguments in your function(Separate function)
5. Avoid names that people don’t understand(code clearly)

__Don’t try to make your code clean at the beginning.__
__Later, try to spend more time to clean your code.__
